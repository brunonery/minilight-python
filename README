This is a MiniLight fork that implements depth and reverse depth image
rendering. MiniLight (http://www.hxa.name/minilight/) is a minimal global
illumination renderer. Depth images show the distance to the points in a scene
instead of their colors. Reverse depth images (I'm still trying to find a
better name for that) show the distance to the point "behind" the same point in
the depth image. In other words, they show the distance to the last point that
intersects the light ray that goes from/to each point.
