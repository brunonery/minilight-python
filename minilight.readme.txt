Description
-----------

MiniLight is a minimal global illumination renderer. It is primarily an exercise
in simplicity. Someone asked me how to develop a renderer in three months. It
seemed not nearly enough time. But then I began to think how small such a
program could be, whilst still being a complete physically based simulation with
a clear, well-formed design...

It is a command-line application. It reads a simple text model file and writes a
PPM image file. Supported platforms include Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Full source code is provided under the (new) BSD license. There are various
translations, all of nine or ten classes/modules. The design follows one for a
full-scale renderer, and an architecture description document is included.

The features are:
* Monte-carlo path-tracing transport
* Emitter sampling
* Progressive refinement
* RGB light
* Diffuse materials
* Triangle modelling primitives
* Octree spatial index
* Pin-hole 'lens'
* Ward linear tone-mapping

See the translation-specific readmes for installation and build information.




Usage
-----

When running it, just supply a model file name, eg.:  
   minilight modelFilePathName

The model file format is:  
   #MiniLight

   iterations

   imagewidth imageheight

   viewposition viewdirection viewangle

   skyemission groundreflection
   trivertex0 trivertex1 trivertex2 reflectivity emitivity  
   trivertex0 trivertex1 trivertex2 reflectivity emitivity  
   ...

-- where iterations and image values are ints, viewangle is a float, and all
other values are three parenthised floats. The file must end with a newline.
For example:
   #MiniLight

   100

   200 150

   (0 0.75 -2) (0 0 1) 45

   (3626 5572 5802) (0.1 0.09 0.07)
   (0 0 0) (0 1 0) (1 1 0)  (0.7 0.7 0.7) (0 0 0)

This description is available using help:  
   minilight {-?|--help}

To interrupt a render, press ctrl-c (or press the 'stop' button).

* World axes are: X positive rightwards, Y positive upwards, Z positive
forwards.
* Triangle front face has clock-wise vertexes.
* Triangles are reflective (therefore visible) on both faces, but emissive on
the front face only.
* errors in a model file may or may not be reported, and then not clearly

### Models ###

Here are the emitter values for the cornell box models:

* morning
   * sky:  8000 K,   5000 cd/m^2 (4532 4712 5756)
* noon
   * sun:  5400 K, 1*10^9 cd/m^2 (1177902548 993796380 828301072)
   * sky: 10000 K,  10000 cd/m^2 (8068 9060 12872)
* evening
   * sun:  2000 K, 5*10^5 cd/m^2 (1182965 313131 3904)
   * sky:  5000 K,    125 cd/m^2 (156 125 94)
   * lamp: equal-energy white, 1000 cd/m^2
* night
   * sky:  8000 K,    0.1 cd/m^2 (0.0906 0.0942 0.1151)
   * lamp: equal-energy white, 1000 cd/m^2

The sun has a diameter of 1.392 x 10^9 m, and distance of 149.6 x 10^9 m. (It is
just a square though.)


### HDRI output ###

Code for outputting images as Ward's RGBE/Radiance format is included in the C++
translation. Search the source for HDRI and substitute-in the commented-out
portions.
